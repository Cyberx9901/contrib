contrib
=======

`contrib` is a repository containing misc useful scripts from Arch Linux team
members. The goal is to collect the myriad of tools we have created through the
years so they can be curated, cleaned up and maybe become part of the `devtools`
package.

### Contribution guidelines
- Some documentation is needed. This can be comments in the top of the file or
  a traditional help command.
